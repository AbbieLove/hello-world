Hello world.
I am Abbie
I'm a 14 yr old girl who doesnt know to much about codeing
My dreams are to work my hardest on code.
Recently in June of 2017 I attempted to kill myself on sleep meds
Safe to say I almost died, anyways I have never got over suicidal thoughts, other than
doing things I want to. Writing code, learning, and more.
I love to have fun. I am not in any relationship, and I love to talk. Feel free to chat with me if you want.
